Features of angular:
1.Develop Across all platforms
2.speed and performance
3.Incredible Tooling
4.Large Communitiy

What should we know
-html,css,js,basic ts

s/w requirement 
nodejs, npm, ts, angular.

node -v
npm -v
tsc -v
npm install -g typescript //install typescript
ng --version
npm install -g @angular/cli //linstall angular

ng new proect-name
ng new myapp > cd myapp > ng serve > go to browser write localhost:4200

ImpNote: in angular only index.html page renders.

root module: app.module.ts
module:it is collection of components, pipes, services, routing file other file.

root compnent: app.component.ts
	component: it is portion in angualr which we are going to display in angular app. it contains=>html,css, ts, spect.ts

root routing file: app-routing.module.ts

component: html, css, ts, spect.ts.

To generate components

ng generate component component-name

DataBinding
1.Interpolation {{}} :ts=>html 
2.Property Binding []: ts=>html (here we set attribute value)
3.Event binding (): html=>ts
4.Two-way DataBinding [()]i: html<=>ts (in this we use ngmodel directory, which is part of forms module
 and for this we have to import FormsModules)

Directives:In angular Directives use for changing DOM element layout as well as appearence and behaviour of it.

1.Component Directives: It is used to display component view and templet.
2.Structural Directives: It is used to change DOM element layout and it is denoted by *(asterik) symbol(*ngIf, *ngFor,
*ngSwitchCase).

3.Attribute Directives: It is used to chnage appearance and behaviour of DOM element.
4.Custome Directives: We can create own directives.

==========================================
Video 3 (10/5/2021)

ng-template: it is used to display output conditionally

Attribude Directives: we can chage the appearence and behaviour of DOM element.

ngStyle,ngClass,ngModel

ngStyle: It is used to apply css property and value to DOM element.
ngClass: here we can apply multiple cseos classes to DOM element.

Task -2

==========================================
Video 4.1 & 4.2: 10/05/2021

*Atrribute directive: we can change appearance and behaviour of Dom element.
ngStyle, ngClass, ngModule

ngStyle: It is used to apply css property and value to the DOM element.
ngClass: here we can apply multiple CSS classes to the DOM element.
ngModule: used to perform two way Data Binding.

*pipes: we can transform property value without changing its original value.

*component interation: here we can get data from one componenth into anather.
			- we need to establish parent child relation between components.
			-@input(): we can get data from parent to child components.(input decorator)
			-@output(): we can get data back from child to parent as well as we need to use object EvenEmitter class.(output decoator)

=========================================

*Routing: we can display components view on browser by setting routing path of components.
	
	Routing components view aways render below "router-outlet" directory.
	-routing is js object and in this we pass two or more keys.
	because of routing we can display the ecompoent view on the browser by settig the routing path.

1.naming routing		//in this we set path name for components
2.default routing 		// in this we keep path blank
2.redirect routing		// here we use redirectTo and pathMatch:"full";
3.parameterize routing	//in this we set parameter in routing path. ex: localhost://4200/pipe/(105/naming(parameter)
5.child routing		// defining routing inside another is called child routing. children property
6.wild-card routing	// it is denoted by ** , and it should be last routing in your routing file.

nav, Angularforms, footer, utdf, rtf, pageNotFound

===========================================

*child routing
*parameterise routing
*router class: with the help of routing class object we can set routing parameter in routing paths as well as
we can perform routing using navigate method.

@ViewChild Decorator done (but not working in myside ) lets see in future
1.UTDF: when we have to create simple form in angular as well as we want to perform form validation at html page we can use UTDF
			in this we use ngForm, ngModel directory
			here in utdf we write form validation at html page 
			most of the code written n html

2.RTF(reactive template form)/modal driven form: when we want to write complex logical code to perform form validation we use rtf
			in this validation code write in ts file
			in this we use FormGroup and FormControl class and to perform as well as to perform validation we use Validators class
			while using reactive form in anular we need to import it in root module (app.module.ts).

formbuilder: it s used to write code n short way it has three method
1.group(): it return object :
2.array():it return object of array;
2.control():it return object of contol;

to use form builder we need to create nstance in the constructor and then we can use it
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
==========================================
video 15: 25/05/2021

*Services -> it is a smple class with extra functionality.
				we can share the data among the component 
				we can implement business logic  in it.
				we can perform external communication (database operation).

		if you want to access service data and functionality in any component we need to create service class object 
		into component constructor this process is called as dependancy injection.

ng g service-name  // generate service

========================================

*Custom Module
ng g module module-name  //genenrate custom module
ng g module module-name --routing		//generate cutom module with routing file

ng g c crud/add	it will generate cmponent in crud module

*Lazyloading: loading module on demand.

*REST fake API  - 
-API (Application Programming interface) 
-REST (Representational state Transform)

JSON- JavaScript Object Notation
*server - json server (Json Server.png)

we have HttpClientModule => in angular it allow to send reques to server database

it is third party module we need to import

step-1: npm install  -g json -sever
steo:2: create json file
step-3: reach to json file and upload dtatbse to json-server
		json-server --watch db.json

get request for /employee => http://localhost:3000/employee
get request with id for /employee => http://localhost:3000/employee/103

post request for /employee => http://localhost:3000/employee

webstorage : we can store user data on browser

local storage: store data for permanently
session storage: store data for limited time

sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value" ); //key and value are in string formate this methos is to create session data
''.getItem("key"); //this methos to get session data 
''.removeItem("key"); //this method is to remove session data

''.clear() // this method is to clear the session data

these method is made in GlobalServce
