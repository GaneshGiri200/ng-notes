1)ngOnChanges()
    - Used in pretty much any component that had an input.
    - Called whenever an input value changes.
    - Is called the first time before ngOnInit.

2)ngOnInit()
    -Used to initialize data in a component.
    - Called after inout values are set when a component is initialized.
    - Added to every component by default by Angualar CLI.
    -Called only once.

3)ngDoCheck()
    - Called during all change detection runs
    - Arun through the view by ANgular to update/dtect changes.

4)ngAfterContentInit()
    - Called only once after first ngDOCheck()
    - Called after the first run throgh of intializing content.


5)ngAfterContentChecked()
    - Called after every ngDoCheck()
    - Waits till after ngAfterContentInit() on first run through


6)ngAfterViewInit()
    -Called after Angular initializes component an child content.
    - Called only once after view intialized.

7)ngAfterViewChecked()

1. By default we have ngonit 

2. Whichever lifecycle hooks we want to use
    1. import it in the class 
    2. Extend the implements interface 
    3. Implement the method  

3. We can have any number of lifecycle hooks implemented 

4. Its too early for us to implement all of them today 

    - We will revisit this topic again component communication 

    - Component Communication 
        - Between components 
            Parent to Child 
            Child to Parent
